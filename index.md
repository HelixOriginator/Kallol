## 🕊️ How to Rise When All Chips Are Down

Kallol was born from the belief that even in collapse, there is rhythm — a return.  
It offers a practical philosophy for researchers, policymakers, and creators:

The **Kallol Concept** turns adversity into motion — helping individuals and institutions rise stronger, like waves returning with greater force.
